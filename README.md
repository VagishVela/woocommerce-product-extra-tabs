woocommerce-product-extra-tabs
==============================

To make extra tabs available in the Woocommerce Product page on Wordpress.

#Multiple Tabs
Copy the area between
```
//****** TAB 1 AREA START HERE ******
```
and
```
//****** TAB 2 AREA ENDS HERE ******
```

And paste it at the end of the document. Then replace ```tab_1``` with ```tab_2```.

Do the above for as many tabs as you need.

#Naming Tabs
Change the name of the two areas in each tab called ```Tab 1``` to whatever name you desire.

#Using the new tabs and inputting content
In the product edit view go to the Custom Fields and select (or type in) ```product_tab_1```, or ```product_tab_2``` for the second tab and so on for as many tabs as you have set up.

Every time you edit the text in custom fields you need to click the update button.

Now you have extra woocommerce product tabs.

#Knowing Issues
Currently doesn't automatically format, so HTML formatting is required.
